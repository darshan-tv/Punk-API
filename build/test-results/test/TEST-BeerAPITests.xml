Brewed Date: 04/2007
Name: The Physics
Description: A hoppy Amber Ale that won World's Best Amber Beer in the World Beer Awards 2007. Malt and hops are in perfect harmony in this incredibly balanced beer. Biscuity, bitter and packing a surprisingly hoppy punch, this beer ultimately morphed into 5AM Saint.
Abv: 5.0

Brewed Date: 04/2007
Name: Paradox Islay
Description: In 2006 James and Martin hijacked a beer dinner run by Michael Jackson, the acclaimed beer and whisky writer, and convinced him to taste one of their home brews. This was a defining moment in BrewDog prehistory, and that beer was the first incarnation of the ubiquitous Paradox. Aged in a variety of casks over the years, Paradox is dark, decadent and encapsulating. Can be enjoyed fresh; phenomenal when aged.

Brewed Date: 04/2007
Name: Peroxide Punk
Description: A trashy blonde concession for those who felt that our original 6% Punk IPA recipe was too hard hitting. This was also the first time we experimented with dry hopping our beers, giving Peroxide Punk a depth of flavour that belies its modest ABV. Zesty, aromatic and thirst quenching.
Abv: 4.0

ID: 101
Brewed Date: 04/2007
Name: Riptide
Description: The original BrewDog, Bracken decided to make a beer that best reflected himself; this is the beer equivalent of the big, cute chocolate monster. Soft, smooth, dark, chocolatey and a force to be reckoned with. This gentle giant will never bite, but you'll still want to be on your best behaviour!
Abv: 8.0

ID: 117
Brewed Date: 04/2007
Name: Hop Rocker
Description: The first of our foray into lager beer, Hop Rocker is a high impact, hoppy behemoth made with 100% malt. Since 2007 we have been obsessive about quality, using only the best ingredients to ensure the flavour and craftsmanship of the beer in your glass. Hop Rocker is testament to that. The malt base gives this beer a sweet, balanced complexity while the combination of New Zealand and German hops merges new world tropical juiciness with old world peppery spice.
Abv: 5.5

ID: 192
Brewed Date: 04/2007
Name: Punk IPA 2007 - 2010
Description: Our flagship beer that kick started the craft beer revolution. This is James and Martin's original take on an American IPA, subverted with punchy New Zealand hops. Layered with new world hops to create an all-out riot of grapefruit, pineapple and lychee before a spiky, mouth-puckering bitter finish.
Abv: 6.0

ID: 1
Name: Buzz
Description: A light, crisp and bitter IPA brewed with English and American hops. A small batch brewed only once.
Abv: 4.5

ID: 2
Name: Trashy Blonde
Description: A titillating, neurotic, peroxide punk of a Pale Ale. Combining attitude, style, substance, and a little bit of low self esteem for good measure; what would your mother say? The seductive lure of the sassy passion fruit hop proves too much to resist. All that is even before we get onto the fact that there are no additives, preservatives, pasteurization or strings attached. All wrapped up with the customary BrewDog bite and imaginative twist.
Abv: 4.1

Name: Berliner Weisse With Yuzu - B-Sides
Description: Japanese citrus fruit intensifies the sour nature of this German classic.
Abv: 4.2

ID: 4
Name: Pilsen Lager
Description: Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Pilsner yeast ferments with no fruity esters or spicy phenols, although it can add a hint of butterscotch.
Abv: 6.3

ID: 5
Name: Avery Brown Dredge
Description: An Imperial Pilsner in collaboration with beer writers. Tradition. Homage. Revolution. We wanted to showcase the awesome backbone of the Czech brewing tradition, the noble Saaz hop, and also tip our hats to the modern beers that rock our world, and the people who make them.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 6
Name: Electric India
Description: Re-brewed as a spring seasonal, this beer – which appeared originally as an Equity Punk shareholder creation – retains its trademark spicy, fruity edge. A perfect blend of Belgian Saison and US IPA, crushed peppercorns and heather honey are also added to produce a genuinely unique beer.
Abv: 5.2

ID: 7
Name: AB:12
Description: An Imperial Black Belgian Ale aged in old Invergordon Scotch whisky barrels with mountains of raspberries, tayberries and blackberries in each cask. Decadent but light and dry, this beer would make a fantastic base for ageing on pretty much any dark fruit - we used raspberries, tayberries and blackberries beause they were local.
Abv: 11.2

ID: 8
Name: Fake Lager
Description: Fake is the new black. Fake is where it is at. Fake Art, fake brands, fake breasts, and fake lager. We want to play our part in the ugly fallout from the Lager Dream. Say hello to Fake Lager – a zesty, floral 21st century faux masterpiece with added BrewDog bitterness.
Abv: 4.7

ID: 9
Name: AB:07
Description: Whisky cask-aged imperial scotch ale. Beer perfect for when the rain is coming sideways. Liquorice, plum and raisin temper the warming alcohol, producing a beer capable of holding back the Scottish chill.
Abv: 12.5

ID: 10
Name: Bramling X
Description: Good old Bramling Cross is elegant, refined, assured, (boring) and understated. Understated that is unless you hop the living daylights out of a beer with it. This is Bramling Cross re-invented and re-imagined, and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. Poor Bramling Cross normally gets lost in a woeful stream of conformist brown ales made by sleepy cask ale brewers. But not anymore. This beer shows that British hops do have some soul, and is a fruity riot of blackberries, pears, and plums. Reminds me of the bramble, apple and ginger jam my grandmother used to make.
Abv: 7.5

ID: 11
Name: Misspent Youth
Description: The brainchild of our small batch brewer, George Woods. A dangerously drinkable milk sugar- infused Scotch Ale.
Abv: 7.3

ID: 12
Name: Arcade Nation
Description: Running the knife-edge between an India Pale Ale and a Stout, this particular style is one we truly love. Black IPAs are a great showcase for the skill of our brew team, balancing so many complex and twisting flavours in the same moment. The citrus, mango and pine from the hops – three of our all-time favourites – play off against the roasty dryness from the malt bill at each and every turn.
Abv: 5.3

ID: 13
Name: Movember
Description: A deliciously robust, black malted beer with a decadent dark, dry cocoa flavour that provides an enticing backdrop to the Cascade hops.
Abv: 4.5

ID: 14
Name: Alpha Dog
Description: A fusion of caramel malt flavours and punchy New Zealand hops. A session beer you can get your teeth into.
Abv: 4.5

ID: 15
Name: Mixtape 8
Description: This recipe is for the Belgian Tripel base. A blend of two huge oak aged beers – half a hopped up Belgian Tripel, and half a Triple India Pale Ale. Both aged in single grain whisky barrels for two years and blended, each beer brings its own character to the mix. The Belgian Tripel comes loaded with complex spicy, fruity esters, and punchy citrus hop character.
Abv: 14.5

ID: 16
Name: Libertine Porter
Description: An avalanche of cross-continental hop varieties give this porter a complex spicy, resinous and citrusy aroma, with a huge malt bill providing a complex roasty counterpoint. Digging deeper into the flavour draws out cinder toffee, bitter chocolate and hints of woodsmoke.
Abv: 6.1

ID: 17
Name: AB:06
Description: Our sixth Abstrakt, this imperial black IPA combined dark malts with a monumental triple dry-hop, using an all-star team of some of our favourite American hops. Roasty and resinous.
Abv: 11.2

ID: 18
Name: Russian Doll – India Pale Ale
Description: The levels of hops vary throughout the range. We love hops, so all four beers are big, bitter badasses, but by tweaking the amount of each hop used later in the boil and during dry- hopping, we can balance the malty backbone with some unexpected flavours. Simcoe is used in the whirlpool for all four beers, and yet still lends different characters to each
Abv: 6.0

ID: 19
Name: Hello My Name Is Mette-Marit
Description: We sent this beer to Norway where it was known as 'Hello, my name is Censored’. You can make up your own mind as to why. This brew was a red berry explosion, with a reisnous bitter edge layered with dry berry tartness.
Abv: 8.2

ID: 20
Name: Rabiator
Description: Imperial Wheat beer / Weizenbock brewed by a homesick German in leather trousers. Think banana bread, bubble gum and David Hasselhoff.
Abv: 10.27

ID: 21
Name: Vice Bier
Description: Our take on the classic German Kristallweizen. A clear German wheat beer, layers of bubblegum and vanilla perfectly balanced with the American and New Zealand hops.
Abv: 4.3

ID: 22
Name: Devine Rebel (w/ Mikkeller)
Description: Two of Europe's most experimental, boundary-pushing brewers, BrewDog and Mikkeller, combined forces to produce a rebellious beer that combined their respective talents and brewing skills. The 12.5% Barley Wine fermented well, and the champagne yeast drew it ever closer to 12.5%. The beer was brewed with a single hop variety and was going to be partially aged in oak casks.
Abv: 12.5

ID: 23
Name: Storm
Description: Dark and powerful Islay magic infuses this tropical sensation of an IPA. Using the original Punk IPA as a base, we boosted the ABV to 8% giving it some extra backbone to stand up to the peated smoke imported directly from Islay.
Abv: 8.0

ID: 24
Name: The End Of History
Description: The End of History: The name derives from the famous work of philosopher Francis Fukuyama, this is to beer what democracy is to history. Complexity defined. Floral, grapefruit, caramel and cloves are intensified by boozy heat.

ID: 27
Name: Dog B
Description: Our anniversary stout was based on AB:04, one of our most sought after beers ever. This beer is slightly different each year, with subtle variations coming into play purely down to environmental and fermentation factors. What doesn't change is the rich dark chocolate, bitter coffee and chilli warmth of this monumental Stout.
Abv: 15.0

ID: 28
Name: HBC 369
Description: HBC 369 brings rich fruity flavours with the tiniest layer of candy coating on top. HBC 369 (the hop) can bring notes of blueberries, pear, and possibly even sweet potato. HBC 369 (the beer) was balanced, with just one hop providing a complex aroma, and a dry bitterness.
Abv: 6.7

ID: 29
Name: 10 Heads High
Description: 10 Heads High is loosely based on our awesome 2011 Prototype beer Hops Kill Nazis. This is an uncompromising 7.8% Imperial Red Ale loaded high with American Hops. Think of this as an Imperial India Red Ale, or a super-charged version of 5am Saint. Either way this is a seriously good beer!
Abv: 7.8

ID: 30
Name: Dana - IPA Is Dead
Description: Hailing from Slovenia, Dana was originally cross bred from the German Hallertau Magnum and native Slovenian varieties. Like any good faux noble hop should, it infuses a rustic, musty spiciness into a toasty beast of a malt base.
Abv: 6.7

ID: 32
Name: AB:05
Description: Belgian Imperial Stout aged on toasted coconut and cacao. The Belgian yeast strain introduces a whole new dimension to the Imperial Stout style resulting in a beer that resembles a marshmallow toasted on a smouldering barbeque then smothered in dark chocolate. Massively seductive and encapsulating this blacker than midnight beer pours with coffee brown head so thick you could almost stand on it, and with an epic lacing on your glass.
Abv: 12.5

ID: 33
Name: Sorachi Ace
Description: A hop that tastes of bubble gum? Seriously? No, we did not believe it either. But it does! This is one unique, son of a bitch of a hop. Lemony, deep, musty with a smoothness that belies its power. This hop is lemony like a lemon who was angry earlier but is now tired because of all the rage. This hop of Japanese origin is best enjoyed trying to make sushi from your gold fish, or trying to persuade your girlfriend (or boyfriend maybe) to dress up as a Geisha for Valentine’s Day.
Abv: 7.5

ID: 36
Name: Shipwrecker Circus (w/ Oskar Blues)
Description: In collaboration with the awesome Oskar Blues from Colorado, we created this big, twisted 10.5% American style barley wine. Big boozy aromas and a sweet viscosity, packed in with some heavy-hitting C-hops, for an intense bitterness to balance this full-bodied malt monster.
Abv: 10.5

ID: 37
Name: Zephyr
Description: A 9.2% Double IPA aged for 21 months in a 1965 Invergordon cask with 30 kg of fresh highland strawberries. This beer is a riot of whisky, caramel and strawberry, all tempered by a toe curling bitterness enducing rapture in all who taste it. Who needs champagne?
Abv: 12.5

ID: 38
Name: Belgian Trappist
Description: Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Abbey style yeasts add distinctive spicy and fruity notes, and dry out the finished beer.
Abv: 6.3

ID: 39
Name: Kohatu - IPA Is Dead
Description: As you’d expect from a New Zealand hop variety, Kohatu contributes bags of tropical fruit, but with loads of lime notes, & pineapple hits. Seriously fruity, with sweet, juicy melon and stonefruit notes.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 40
Name: Hello My Name is Vladimir
Description: A Limonnik-infused, triple dry- hopped double IPA. Dry berry tartness and intense citrus hop character meld with a dry bready malt base, boosted by a hint of alcohol warmth. This beer was brewed as a protest against the anti-LGBT legislation in Russia surrounding the Sochi Olympics.
Abv: 8.2

ID: 41
Name: AB:17
Description: A triple whammy of coffee from HasBean gives our 17th Abstrakt concept beer an intense and roasty, dark mocha character. We brewed with espresso in the mash, cafetiere in the boil, and whole roast beans in the whirlpool and the fermenter.
Abv: 10.7

ID: 42
Name: Hardcore IPA
Description: Pounding a triple payload of the biggest North American hops humanity has devised, braced by a backbone of caramel malt, this beer is deep, astringent and resinous, pushing to the extremes of lupulin thresholds. There’s nothing inscrutable going on; no mystery in the backstory. It doesn’t seek to be understood. A beer incapable of empathy; only hop overload.
Abv: 9.2

ID: 44
Name: Dog Wired (w/8 Wired)
Description: Brewed in collaboration with Soren from New Zealand’s stellar 8-Wired brewery, this is an Imperial Pilsner featuring two of our favourite New Zealand hops: Nelson Sauvin and Motueka. Sitting at a dangerously drinkable 7.1% ABV there’s a touch of Munich malt which gives this beer that little extra caramel biscuit bite to compliment the lip smackingly tropical hops. Expect an all out NZ hoppy riot.
Abv: 7.1

ID: 46
Name: Anarchist Alchemist
Description: About as far as you can push an IPA; Anarchist Alchemist packs in three times the malt and three of our favourite hops. Nelson Sauvin, Amarillo and Centennial bring a range of flavours, touching on tropical fruit, white grape, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, spiced orange... the list goes on!
Abv: 16.5

ID: 47
Name: AB:15
Description: A salted caramel popcorn Imperial Ale. Bourbon and Rum barrel aged, this 12.8% ale has complex and twisting flavours. Bitter caramel, wood, smoke, spice, treacle and vanilla are all present and intertwine against a smooth and lightly chewy mouthfeel. The salted caramel popcorn lends subtle hints of a smoky brininess.
Abv: 12.8

ID: 48
Name: Goldings - IPA Is Dead
Description: This is East Kent Goldings re- invented and re-imagined and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. In this amped up Goldings reincarnation expect to be slammed with floral lavender, a fruity riot of blackberries and spiced pears, bubblegum, plums and the illusion of thyme.
Abv: 6.7

Abv: 10.0

ID: 50
Name: Lost Dog (w/Lost Abbey)
Description: Our first beer aged in rum casks, Lost Dog saw us brew a collaboration imperial porter with our friends at Lost Abbey. The base beer was packed with toffee, chocolate and roasty notes, balanced with a subtle spicy hop character. The rum casks add a warming, spiced vanilla edge.
Abv: 10.0

ID: 52
Name: Paradox Islay
Description: In 2006 James and Martin hijacked a beer dinner run by Michael Jackson, the acclaimed beer and whisky writer, and convinced him to taste one of their home brews. This was a defining moment in BrewDog prehistory, and that beer was the first incarnation of the ubiquitous Paradox. Aged in a variety of casks over the years, Paradox is dark, decadent and encapsulating. Can be enjoyed fresh; phenomenal when aged.
Abv: 10.0

ID: 54
Name: Albino Squid Assasin
Description: This tentacled terminator packs a punch - ten punches to be precise. Each hop addition adds to the intense layers of depth in this red rye IPA. Toasty caramel & cinder toffee from crystal malts, cacao richness from intensely roasted malt and the spiciness of rye. Zesty pithiness from Citra and the robust resin of Chinook. This small batch exclusive brew is up-front intensity matched with twisted complexity. The can features awesome custom art from Joe Wilson.
Abv: 7.4

ID: 55
Name: Amarillo - IPA Is Dead
Description: Citrus fruit. Lots of citrus fruit. Think blood orange, orange zest and grapefruit, tangerine and lemon; the fruit is balanced by floral notes in the most classic of new wave IPA hops. Amarillo adds a zesty, pithy character that sits beautifully alongside hints of toffee and honeycomb.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 56
Name: Black Eyed King Imp
Description: An early Cocoa Psycho recipe that we loved, but didn't fit what we were looking for. We locked this chocolate coffee stout away in barrels for two years, imparting toasted marshmallow, spicy vanilla, molasses and boozy warmth.
Abv: 9.5

ID: 57
Name: Prototype 27
Description: Hardcore IPA with raspberries aged in Caol Ila casks. Full-bodied and compelling, the robust malt base provides an initial layer of honey, cinnamon and biscuity malt sweetness. Soon the Scottish berries are in on the act, a dominating tug of war between sweet and tart with an overbearing zest. As the beer slips back across your tongue the hops demand and definitely get your attention. At 100 IBUs the bitterness smashes into the back of your throat as the resinous, spiced orange peel flavours add depth to the berry fruitiness.
Abv: 9.2

ID: 58
Name: Coffee Imperial Stout
Description: This beer was released as both as "Danish Beerhouse Coffee Imperial Stout" and "BrewDog Coffee Imperial Stout". Deep, dark, roasted flavours make this a perfect Sunday brunch beer.
Abv: 9.0

ID: 59
Name: Mandarina Bavaria - IPA Is Dead
Description: From the central European plains of Germany, comes something very different. A blast of tangerine and orange, Mandarina Bavaria brings a highly distinctive backbone of flavour. This is down to its parent – Cascade – and a frankly enormous 70% myrcene oil content. If equate Germany solely with earthy, spicy Noble hops, Mandarina Bavaria will make you think again.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 60
Name: Dogma
Description: Brewed with over ten different types of malt, and blended together with Scottish heather honey, it is a pantheon to the gods of intricacy and nuance; a beer that celebratesa confluence of ideas. Complex, indulgent and encapsulating, Dogma gives more than a cursory nod to history, to make you ponder the very nature of beer itself.
Abv: 7.5

ID: 62
Name: AB:08
Description: Flavours and aromas you'd expect from a Stout, but brewed without dark malts. The full mouthfeel comes courtesy of wheat and oats, while smoked malt and the twist additions add the complex flavours normally provided by highly kilned malts.
Abv: 10.43

ID: 63
Name: Sunk Punk
Description: It's rumoured just a drop can calm the fiercest of storms. A balance of sweet, salt and savoury, citrus, spruce and caramel. Fermented at the bottom of the North Sea, which just so happens to be the perfect temperature for lagers to ferment.
Abv: 7.1

ID: 66
Name: Tokyo Rising Sun - Lowland
Description: A forgotten gem in the deepest, darkest corner of the warehouse. Aged in a Lowland whisky cask resulting in decadent chocolate, toasted vanilla, indulgent spiced fruit, a mesmerizingly hypnotic mouthfeel and new layers that emerge on every sip.
Abv: 13.2

ID: 69
Name: AB:16
Description: On the nose, clove and nutmeg, cafe au lait, subtle dark fruit notes, and hints of candied lemon peel. On the palate, smooth & fruity espresso, milk chocolate, and warm brandy-soaked currants are in the middle of a high-class dance-off against the spicy and peppery Belgian character. The overall impression evokes malt loaf or ginger cake.
Abv: 10.6

ID: 70
Name: Sunmaid Stout
Description: Brewed by Chris Sartori from Stone Brewing Company in 2010. A dark chocolate stout with dried dark fruit finish. Simcoe provides bitterness with subtle fruity supporting notes, contrasting the chocolate and coffee-laden malt profile. The finish is warming with vanilla and rich dark fruit depth.
Abv: 10.2

Description: Deconstructed whisky sour, reconstructed as a beer.
Abv: 7.0

ID: 73
Name: Black Eyed King Imp - Vietnamese Coffee Edition
Description: This is the Vietnamese Coffee Edition. At 12.7% ABV, Black Eyed King Imp is a super intense and twistedly complex brew, with intense notes of sweet vanilla, rich espresso, smooth molasses and bitter chocolate barely contained by the whatever container it's in.
Abv: 12.7

ID: 75
Name: Never Mind The Anabolics
Description: Never Mind the Anabolics, a 6.5% India Pale Ale brewed with copious amounts of performance-enhancing natural ingredients. Brewed to commemorate the 2012 Olympics and its merry marketing bandwagon.
Abv: 6.5

ID: 76
Name: #Mashtag 2013
Description: A rich, nutty Brown Ale with a deep, rich malt profile, hopped with a range of citrusy and spicy US varieties. Mellow yet endlessly complex, with enough chocolate and fruit character to balance the bitterness, and a soft oaky roundness.
Abv: 7.5

ID: 78
Name: AB:18
Description: AB:18 began life as an Imperial Brown Ale before we bombarded it with Scottish tayberries and Purple raspberries and locked it away in rum barrels for two years, infusing rich dark fruit flavours and oaky warmth into the mix.
Abv: 11.8

ID: 79
Name: Hops Kill Nazis
Description: 5AM Saint's big brother. Dry- hopping with Chinook gave Hops Kill Nazis a full-on, instantly recognisable US hop character - huge resinous aromas (think giant redwood) with a bitter grapefruit edge. The caramel malts bring flavours of toffee and burnt sugar, which gave Hops Kill Nazis a big, complex malt base supporting the intense hopping.
Abv: 7.6

Abv: 15.0

ID: 82
Name: Hopped-Up Brown Ale - Prototype Challenge
Description: Brown ales are perfect foils for resinous C-Hops, as the piney elements of the latter contrast brilliantly with the sweeter, nutty elements of the malt bill. The best of both worlds.

Name: Bavarian Weizen
Description: Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Bavarian Weizen yeast adds traditional weissbier notes of banana and clove.

ID: 89
Name: Citra
Description: The Pacific North West of America is home to the Citra hop. America is not just about cheer leaders, a silly version of football, elastic top jeans and cheeseburgers. They grow remarkable hops and Citra is a killer example of this, embodying all that is good about American hops and then some. Fearfully hard to resist, this beer is loaded with brash citrus, grapefruit, orange, hints of resinous pine and touches of blackcurrant. Devilishly moreish.

Bright, vibrant aromas of tangerine, mandarin and peach, with zesty hits of lime, envelop the nutty, caramel malt backbone. The intense fruitiness gives a jammy quality to the nose. On the palate is a warm biscuity sweetness, with tropical fruits in a supporting role to a huge grapefruit and orange bitterness.

Aromas of caramel and toasted marshmallow, with raisin and dried fruit, alongside a spicy undercurrent of resin.

Name: India Pale Weizen (w/ Weihenstephan)
Description:  BrewDog vs. Weihenstephan India Pale Weizen kicked off a new direction for our collaborations. We took a simple concept (by our standards) and teamed up with the oldest brewery in the world to brew a mash-up beer using the signature styles of both breweries. India Pale Weizen has classic base hefeweizen aromas and flavours of banana, clove and bubblegum, with a distinctive haziness. Layered on top of this is a tapestry of US citrus hop character. India Pale Weizen is a perfect symbiosis of traditional and modern brewing.

Description: Our Unleash the Yeast series was an epic experiment into the differences in aroma and flavour provided by switching up your yeast. We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. American Ale used a clean fermenting strain which provides some faint fruity notes.
Abv: 6.3

ID: 109
Name: Cocoa Psycho
Description: Vanilla pods and toasted oak chips add a rounded character to this massive Russian Imperial Stout, brewed with a hefty malt bill, cacao nibs and coffee beans. Dark malts combine with Cascade to add a punchy bitterness, strong enough to offset the big chocolate sweetness.

Abv: 8.5

ID: 124
Name: Chaos Theory
Description: Chaos Theory is the most under- rated achievement of 20th Century science. This beer can only aspire to parallel to the mathematical use of the word chaos, which is at odds to the common parlance. The purest showcase of the magnificent hop that is Nelson Sauvin; grapefruit, pineapple and caramel sing above the chaos of life.
Abv: 7.1

ID: 127
Name: Galaxy
Description: With all the rich tropical flavour you'd expect from Australia's Galaxy, this beer backs up a strong citrus aroma and flavour with a mellow undercurrent of passion fruit and mango. Zingy and sweet but not too sweet, Galaxy has a soft and inviting fruity hop character.

Description: Hinterland is a beer long in the creation, and even longer in the appreciation. On the aroma, deep reverberating roasty bitterness and sweet dark chocolate. Also in evidence, woodsmoke, rich vanilla, mocha and marzipan.

Abv: 6.7

ID: 134

ID: 136
Name: #Mashtag 2014
Description: A slightly psychotic, orange-that- thinks-it’s-a-grapefruit character builds upon and intensifies the hop bitterness, squaring up against the rich sweet malt base. The result is a huge Red Ale with a drinkable quality you’d expect in a beer half this strength.
Abv: 9.0

ID: 137
Name: Sink The Bismarck!
Description: This is IPA amplified, the most evocative style of the craft beer resistance with the volume cranked off the scale. Kettle hopped, dry hopped then freeze hopped for a deep fruit, resinous and spicy aroma. A full on attack on your taste buds ensues as the incredibly smooth liquid delivers a crescendo of malt, sweet honey, hop oils and a torpedo of hop bitterness that lasts and lasts.
Abv: 41.0

ID: 138
Name: Dog A
Description: Our anniversary stout was based on AB:04, one of our most sought after beers ever. This beer is slightly different each year, with subtle variations coming into play purely down to environmental and fermentation factors.

Abv: 15.0

ID: 139
Name: Born To Die
Description: Savagely bitter, exceptionally dry, this IPA is born to die on a predetermined day. It proudly displays its short-lived life span front and centre. There is no better time to drink this than the moment you get your paws on it. Awesome bitterness backed up by unrelenting aromas of resin, citrus, and juicy fruit. Born To Die is a eulogy to the hops that sacrificed themselves in its creation. An incredibly ambitious and satisfying small batch brew.
Abv: 8.5

ID: 140
Name: Pioneer - IPA Is Dead
Description: 2015 IPA is Dead Series. Pioneer hails from the hop gardens of Kent, and for those expecting something classically English, they surprise with an unforeseen blast of lemony citrus.

ID: 146
Name: Nelson Sauvin
Description: Nelson is a love it or hate it kinda hop. We are cool with that, if we wanted to keep everyone happy we would be brewing Fosters anyway. Sharp as a razor, this New Zealand hop slices its way through your taste buds and is brutally resinous, almost scraping the intense flavours of passion fruit along your poor tongue. There is a huge depth of tropical fruit flavour with astringent gooseberry balanced against the robust malt base. Throw another shrimp on the barbie mate and you are all set. New Zealand is near Austria, right?
Abv: 7.5

ID: 148
Name: AB:02

Abv: 18.0

ID: 149
Name: AB:03

Full bodied with huge chocolate, coffee and roast flavours, this imperial stout employs a variety of hops to add enough bitterness and hop complexity to balance the huge malt sweetness and rich mocha and molasses flavours.
Abv: 9.5

ID: 156
Name: Hoppy Christmas
Description: Pineapple, citrus and papaya; single-hopped with Simcoe, Hoppy Christmas is an anti-festive IPA, redolent with summery flavours. Small caramel malt additions provide a touch of malt complexity. Simcoe, arguably our favourite hop, carries this beer - pine, tropical fruit and bitterness are its specialities.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 158
Name: Hello My Name Is Ze? (w/ 2Cabec?as)
Description: Punk multiplied by Jack Hammer, divided by passionfruit with some Brazilian spirit factored in too. A well-rounded IPA, with bags of tropical flavour boosted by the addition of passionfruit, which unsurprisingly dominates the aroma of this summery IPA.

ID: 160
Name: Restorative Beverage For Invalids And Convalescents
Description: Brewed to 8.5%, light as a mass market Pilsner in colour, fermented to be as dry as a Lambic, but as bitter as any double IPA and loaded with as much hop aroma as we can get into a beer. The fermentables in this beer were Maris Otter Extra Pale along with plenty of sugar as we mashed at a very low temperature to ensure maximum fermentability and attenuation. This beer is fermented within an inch of its life making it dry, sheer and bright. Citra, Amarillo & Centennial were all used in abundance in the kettle and also fired extremely liberally at this beer with our high tech hop cannon.

Name: Ella - IPA Is Dead
Description: 2015 IPA is Dead Series. Supremely floral, this hugely under-rated hop is related to Galaxy and was first cultivated in the Australian state of Victoria. Initially given the same name as a certain Eurolager, their lawyers got involved and the St- prefix was dropped. Ella displays subtle notes of spice, but is fundamentally a truly floral bouquet, redolent of the Southern Hemisphere.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 165
Name: Barley Wine - Russian Doll
Description: Russian Doll was an experimental set of brews showcasing the effects of varying the amount and ratio of malts in the grist.

Abv: 10.0

ID: 167
Name: Libertine Black Ale
Description: A dark hop bomb combining the malt-forward indulgences of a stout with the insatiable hopload of an IPA. Rich spiced blackcurrant and caramel up front, with a sharp bitter finish following behind, bringing grapefruit and resin with it. Dry, bitter and intense; this is an IPA first and foremost, given a dark malt makeover. Originally brewed as a Simcoe only single hop IPA, we've experimented with adding a little Cascade and Mosaic for extra depth.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 168
Name: Jack Hammer
Description: Hopped beyond the point at which IBUs are measurable, only the most hardened palate will get beyond Jack Hammer's intensely resinous pithy bitterness and to the grapefruit, orange zest and dry biscuity malt beyond. You could brew this with less hops, but really, why would you bother?
Abv: 7.2

ID: 169
Name: AB:19
Description: One of the most complex beers we’ve ever attempted. A blend of two barrel-aged Imperial Saisons – one black, one red – which has in turn then been aged in rum barrels, it is an enormous, intricate beer. A baseline of warm, smoky raisin and plum, followed by punchy flavour elements coming to the fore – coconut, mint and blackcurrant. There’s a long undercurrent of treacle toffee, before the finish darkens to liquorice, star anise amidst a touch of honey sweetness.
Abv: 13.1

Abv: 9.7

ID: 171
Name: Challenger
Description: Challenger is known for its herbal and fruity characteristics. When used alone in a beer like IPA is Dead, Challenger brings light woodsy notes, floral hints, and delicate green tea, alongside more recognisable citrus notes. As a dual-purpose hop, it also yields great bittering potential, which is ideal in a dry bitter IPA.
Abv: 6.7

ID: 173
Name: Chinook - IPA Is Dead
Description: 2015 IPA is Dead series. Often used as a combination hop for American Pale Ales and IPAs, Chinook can really shine when left to front a beer all on its own. The main reason for this is that it’s thunderously piney, with a fistful of spice kicked up in your face as you lie on the beach. A true heavyweight of the brewing industry.
Abv: 7.2

ID: 175
Name: San Diego Scotch Ale (w/Ballast Point)

Abv: 10.2

ID: 200
Name: Double IPA - Russian Doll
Description: The levels of hops vary throughout the range. We love hops, so all four beers are big, bitter badasses, but by tweaking the amount of each hop used later in the boil and during dry- hopping, we can balance the malty backbone with some unexpected flavours. Simcoe is used in the whirlpool for all four beers, and yet still lends different characters to each.

Description: Jack Hammer has been single handedly ripping it up for quite some time. Now, the definitive bitter and twisted IPA, has spawned four Hammer Head off-springs. Black Hammer is the second of our hyped up hybrid IPAs. A black hearted beast, that takes no prisoners. American hops and dark malt combine to make mischief. Grapefruit and coffee collide in sensory overload – a wake-up call for other IPA’s. Molten waves of pithy grapefruit build and finally ebb to the roasty bitter onslaught. Stand  firm and wield the Black Hammer with care. Stare into the black abyss and succumb to the dark-side.

Description: Good old Bramling Cross is elegant, refined, assured, (boring) and understated. Understated that is unless you hop the living daylights out of a beer with it. This is Bramling Cross re-invented and re-imagined, and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. Poor Bramling Cross normally gets lost in a woeful stream of conformist brown ales made by sleepy cask ale brewers. But not anymore. This beer shows that British hops do have some soul, and is a fruity riot of blackberries, pears, and plums. Reminds me of the bramble, apple and ginger jam my grandmother used to make.

Name: Sorachi Ace
Description: A hop that tastes of bubble gum? Seriously? No, we did not believe it either. But it does! This is one unique, son of a bitch of a hop. Lemony, deep, musty with a smoothness that belies its power. This hop is lemony like a lemon who was angry earlier but is now tired because of all the rage. This hop of Japanese origin is best enjoyed trying to make sushi from your gold fish, or trying to persuade your girlfriend (or boyfriend maybe) to dress up as a Geisha for Valentine’s Day.
